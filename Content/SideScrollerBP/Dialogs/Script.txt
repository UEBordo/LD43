*Devant la grotte*

	Hatty: Woo! That cavity looks reaaaaally small.
	Hatty: What ? You can't bend your knees with your leg armor?
	Hatty: Aw you'll need to let them here then...
*Dans la grotte*

	Hatty: I know you liked this piece of armor but we had to let it go...
	Hatty: Woaaah dude look at these shiny rocks!
	Hatty: I really wanna take one but they don't look movable.

*Arrive devant le garde du village*

	Guard: Wowowow, what happened, why are you half naked?
	Hatty: We had to make a few sacrifices along the way.
	Hatty: But we were victorious!
	Guard: Huh, alright I guess.
	Guard: I can't let you get in with that sword, though.
	Hatty: What ?! But that's our only item left...
	Guard: The rules have changed. 
	Guard: You've been gone for quite a long time buddy.
	Hatty: Okay, let's drop it here then...

*Entre dans le village*

	Hatty: We're finally home!
	Hatty: You lost all of your favorite items on the way though...
	Hatty: Hey we HAVE TO see the town chief,
	Hatty: He'll give us our reward!

*Arrive à quelques mètres de la porte du chef*

	Hatty: Uuuuuuuuh Tom?
	Hatty: We can't get through that door with me on your head...
	Hatty: No, it's the guard at the door. 
	Hatty: He's super afraid of bunnies.
	Hatty: DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE DID THE LAST TIME?!
	Hatty: You gotta let me behind Tom, you know, so you can get in.
	Hatty: About the speech and honors ? 
	Hatty: It's okay Tom, just put me here, I'll wait for your return.

*Rentre voir le chef*

	Chief: Tom! You're finally back from your quest!
	Chief: I can see on your face that it wasn't an easy journey...
	Chief: You got rid of all the monsters nearby the village.
	Chief: Congratulations Tom, here, take your reward...

*Pendant la remise des récompenses, Hatty tombe dans la pièce depuis la cheminée avec un nuage de fumée et rigole*
