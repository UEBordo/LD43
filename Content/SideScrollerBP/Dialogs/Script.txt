	Hatty : Let's beat that thing!

*Devant la grotte*

	Hatty : Woo! That cavity looks reaaaaally small.
	Hatty : I'm sorry Tom but I think we gotta let that armor behind.

	Hatty: We're finally home!
	Hatty: You lost a lot of your favorite items on the way though...
	Hatty: Hey we HAVE TO see the town chief, he'll give us our reward!
*Arrive à quelques mètres de la porte du chef*
	Hatty: Uuuuuuuuh Tom?
	Hatty: I'm pretty sure we can't get through that door with me on your head...
	Hatty: No, it's the guard at the door, he really doesn't like hats at all.
	Hatty: You gotta let me behind Tom, you know, so you can get in.
	Hatty: About the speech and honors ? 
	Hatty: It's okay Tom, just put me here, I'll wait for your return.
*Rentre voir le chef*
*Pendant la remise des récompenses, Hatty tombe de la cheminée avec un nuage de fumée et rigole*
